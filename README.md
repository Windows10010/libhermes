# libhermes
The software libraries for project hermes.

This is the software library for our project, which is to send a probe up to the sky with an altitude of about 30000 meters.
Our probe utilizes GSP module, GSM module(SIM7600CE), and multiple environment sensors. We use an Arduino Mega2560 as the main controler. Most of the sensors and the electronic components come from seeedstudio.com, my favourate hardware shop.
